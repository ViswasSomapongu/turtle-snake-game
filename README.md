## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game with Special Food project! This Python-based game is an enhanced version of the classic Snake game. In this game, players control a snake on the screen, collect food items to score points, and navigate through special food challenges. The project showcases Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including class hierarchy, encapsulation, and inheritance.

## Features

### Classic Snake Gameplay with User Controls

### Special Food Items that Affect Score and Snake Length

- Unique twist with special food item.

### Scoreboard to Display Player's Score and High Score

- Dynamic scoreboard displays your current score and the all-time high score.
- Real-time updates as you collect food items.
- High score data is stored externally for persistence across game sessions.

### Timer-Based Disappearance of Special Food Items

- Special food items disappear after a set time, adding a sense of urgency.
- Strategy comes into play as you decide when to go for special food items based on remaining time.

### High Score Data Stored Externally for Persistence

- Maintain your high score across game sessions.
- Your high score is saved in an external file, ensuring it's preserved even if you close and reopen the game.
- Compete with your own previous high scores and feel a sense of achievement.

## Object-Oriented Programming

This project demonstrates key OOP concepts:
- *Classes:* Used to structure the game components (Snake, Food, Scoreboard, Specialfood).
- *Inheritance:* Specialfood inherits from Food, allowing for unique food behaviors.
- *Encapsulation:* Data and behavior are encapsulated within each class.
- *Methods and Functions:* Methods define behavior, while functions handle game logic.
- *Attributes and Properties:* Attributes store data, and properties control object characteristics.
- *Polymorphism:* Handle different food types uniformly for collision and game state updates.
